# cripple.js

cripple.js is a small script designed to cripple the Javascript capabilities of your browser, rendering akin to an IE8 (see <http://kangax.github.com/es5-compat-table/>) browser.  

To use it simply, include it in your test application / page prior to running application logic:

```html
<script src="https://raw.github.com/DamonOehlman/cripple.js/master/cripple.js"></script>
```
